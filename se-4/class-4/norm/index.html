            Dragons are legendary creatures that breathe fire and have 2 or 4
            legs. They're pretty dangerous, and will definitely bite or swallow
            you whole. Here's a baby dragon:

            Next I will have some images of adult dragons, to observe in their
            natural habitat.

          <p>
            As seen in the photo above, there isn't much to dragon anatomy, the
            interesting thing is it's wings, which also act as another pair of
            limbs. They enable the American dragons to fly, which Chinese
            dragons don't need, since their flight abilities mostly depend on
            magic.

          <p>
            Dragons in lore have been prevalent in lore for many centuries,
            originating in China, and spreading across the world, with many
            mutations such as the American dragon.
